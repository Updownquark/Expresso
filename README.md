# Expresso

This was intended to be a tokenless parsing framework that could parse anything using easy-to-read XML grammar.  Its development has stopped for the foreseeable future.

Most of what I was intending to do with this (and some of the source code) has been pulled into the ObServe project under the org.observe.expresso package.  The original concept has defeated me for the last time and since I now have an ANTLR-based solution to the problem I was trying to solve, I don't intend to try it again.
